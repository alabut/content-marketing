Now with well over 100,000 users (141,365 as of writing this to be exact), passing 250 integration partners (253 to be exact) and redesigning the site (check it out!) we thought this would be a great time to reflect on year two of Zapier (year one got a great review here).</p>

                        <p>But before we do that, <strong>we want to thank the thousands of users</strong> who have given Zapier a chance and <strong>the hundreds of integration partners</strong> who trust us each day to take care of their customers integrations. We don't take that responsibility lightly and are excited about working with you to build a tool that can give you internet superpowers.</p>

                        <p>Right off the bat in January James joined and started building out the infrastructure. In March Cooksey came on board to help build out the developer platform (some pretty awesome stuff getting ready to launch here). Then in August, Danny joined to help increase the quality and quantity of content we publish on the Zapier blog. Then in November, Al joined to take design to the next level. In fact, this post is courtesy Al's great design chops.</p>
                        
                        <h3>CHANGING HOW YOU WORK AS YOU GROW</h3>
                        <p>One of the challenging, but fan parts about being a small team where you are the one and only expert on your craft is that you get to be an army of one. But after a while that can be tiring, so in 2014 we're planning to experiment with working in small teams - perhaps teams of two or three. The best teams grow and adapt as new resources become available.</p>
                        
                        <h3>EMBRACING REMOTE WORK</h3>

                        <p>As the team grows, most companies think about consolidating locations - instead we embraced remote work with open arms. Amongst our 8 teammates we have people in Sunnyvale, California, San Francisco, California, Columbia, Missouri, Chicago, Illinois and Omaha Nebraska. We're pretty excited to see where 2014 will quite literally take us.</p>

                        <h3>WHILE ENJOYING EACH OTHER'S COMPANY</h3>

                        <p>Just because we work remotely doesn't mean we can't have fun getting together. In March of this year the whole team got together for PyCon in Santa Clara, California and in August we all made the trek to Seattle, Washington for a week long company retreat.</p>

                        <p>Here's what we learned about running a company retreat with a remote team.</p>

                        <p>At the end of December 2012 there was roughly 120 supported services on Zapier, most of which had been added by us. But realizing it was best for users if others could add integrations in August of 2012 we launched the Zapier developer platform.</p>

                        <p>This set the stage for adding over 130 integrations to Zapier in 2013. And true to it's purpose the developer platform allowed anyone to add an integration to Zapier. While the Zapier team spent a lot of time and effort on supporting and maintaining current integrations, relatively little was spent on adding new services. Thanks for helping make Zapier better!</p>

                      <h3>SECTION ON FEBRUARY REDESIGN</h3>

                      <p>2013 got off to a bang with a fresh redesign. The January version of Zapier was drag-and-drop and playful. The home page featured the app and the hypothesis was that being able to get started right away would be best for conversions. </p>

                      <p>But unfortunately that wasn't the case. It turns out drag-and-drop is really hard on mobile devices (actually impossible). People have also been conditioned to look for a signup button and when one wasn't easily found they bounced quickly.</p>

                      <p>So the February redesign focused on fixing those two things. We implemented a more traditional homepage with an obvious call-to-action for signing up and we also nuked drag-and-drop everywhere so that click or touch actions could allow the user to do everything. Those simple changes brought conversion rates for new signups to active user from 34% to 50%. A huge bump.</p>

                      <h3>SECTION ON NOVEMBER REDESIGN</h3>

                      <p>While the February redesign was an improvement, Zapier was still limping along as an engineering driven team without a much design help. It was pretty obvious that if we could bring on a full-time designer we'd be able to reap the rewards of having someone who is an expert in their field making Zapier easier to use and easier to remember. </p>

                      <p>Thus just a few weeks ago we relaunched Zapier as the web app that gives you internet superpowers. The new design has already boosted visit to signup conversion rates by over 25% and we're seeing more engagement with the app. Remember kids, don't undervalue design.</p>

                      <h3>SUPPORTING 150,000 USERS</h3>

                      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3ldrNoG.png"></p>

                      <p>Support is one of the huge value adds we strive to provide at Zapier. There's a couple things we truly believe.</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>No one really wants to have to talk to support</li>
                        <li>Sometimes you have to talk to support, and hopefully that experience is great</li>
                      </ol>
                      
                      <p>One thing we've always done at Zapier is support drive development, but in March we formalized the process to help speed up ticket responses to help address belief number 2. Our average response time compared to the previous month improved immediately from 5 hours, 37 minutes to 3 hours, 55 minutes. But having more a better system to do support didn't address belief number 1.</p>

                      <p>So in July of 2012 we buckled down and wrote help docs for as much of the 250 integrations we support as possible. And instantly the number of support queries we received starting going down. Fortunately we kept growing and while the percent of users who send in requests is lower than before the total quantity is going up again. In 2014 we'll be experimenting with a few new things to try and provide the best overall support experience possible.</p>
