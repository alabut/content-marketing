                        <p>We doubled-down <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/">on being a remote team</a>. Among our eight-person crew, we have people in San Francisco and Mountain View, Calif., Columbia, Mo., Omaha, Neb., and Chicago, Ill. We're excited to see where next year will, quite literally, take us.</p>
                        <h3>While Enjoying Each Other's Company</h3>
                        <p>Just because we work remotely doesn't mean we don't get together and have fun. In March, the team came together for <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2013/">PyCon</a> in Santa Clara, Calif., and in August we all made the trek to Seattle, Wash. for a week-long company retreat.</p>

                        <h3>From 123 to 260</h3>
                        <p>In December 2012, our integration platform supported 123 web services, many of which had been added by us. Realizing the potential benefits to users if integrations could be quickly added without the need of our small team, in August we <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/announcing-zapier-developer-platform-join-hubspot-podio-and-12-others/">launched our developer platform</a>. This set the stage for <strong>adding 137 integrations</strong> to Zapier in 2013.</p>


                        <h3>Engineering Growth</h3>

                        <p>Handling millions of API calls every day is <em>not</em> a simple feat. By the end of 2013, Zapier was run by over 70 servers on Amazon's Web Service, up from a mere dozen or so at the beginning of 2013.</p>

                        <p>Zapier is all about chosing the right tool for the specific job at hand. On the engineering side, that goes double. We employ several different databases (MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, RethinkDB, RedShift), a handful of different frameworks (Django, SQLAlchemy, Puppet, Backbone.js) and of course a few of our favorite languages (Python, Coffeescript/Javascript, Ruby). If it's the right tool for the job, we'll use it.</p>

                        <p>All of this is accomplished with only 4 engineers on the team!</p>


                        <h3>Rapidly Adding Users through Referrals</h3>
                        <p>With the team and developer platform set, we were ready to take on more users. And it's thanks to our existing users that they came—on average, we received # referrals per week. Over the past year, we rose from 38,000 to 150,000 users, thanks in part to customer referrals.</p>

                        <h3>Building for &amp; supporting a growing user base</h3>

                        <p>Keeping 150,000 users happy doesn't come without challenges. Here's how we did it.</p>

                        <p>[INSERT SCREENSHOTS]</p>

                        <h3>February Redesign</h3>

                        <p>The January version of Zapier was drag-and-drop and playful. The homepage featured the Zap editor and the hypothesis was that being able to get started using the product right away would be best for user conversions. (alt: The homepage allowed users to immediately begin making integrations; our hypothesis was that if the faster they began using the product, the more likely they’d be to sign up.)</p>

                        <p>But, unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We learned:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Drag-and-drop functionality is hard to build and use on mobile devices</li>
                            <li>People have been conditioned to look for an obvious sign up button on landing pages, and when they can't easily find one, they leave the site quickly</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Focused on remedying these two issues, we implemented a more traditional homepage with an obvious call-to-action to sign up and scrapped our drag-and-drop editor so that the user could do everything with simple click or touch actions.</p>

                        <p>These simple changes brought conversion rates for new signups to active user <strong>from 34% to 50%.</strong> That's a huge bump!</p>

                        <h3>November Redesign</h3>

                        <p>Though the February redesign was an improvement, we felt Zapier was still limping along as an engineering-driven team without ample design resources. It was obvious that if we could bring on a full-time designer, we'd be able to reap the rewards of having someone who is an expert in their field, making Zapier easier to use and easier to remember. </p>

                        <p>Thus, just a few weeks ago we <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/inside-guide-new-zapier-now-250-supported-services/">relaunched Zapier</a> as the web app that gives you internet superpowers.</p>

                        <p>Excellent support is a crucial value add we strive to provide at Zapier. We believe:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>No one really wants to require support</li>
                            <li>Sometimes you need support, and when you do, that experience should be great</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Zapier has always been <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/support-driven-development/">support-driven development</a> and in March we formalized the process to help speed up ticket responses to help address belief No. 2.But, this improved system to offer support didn't address belief No. 1.</p>
                        <p>So, in July, to empower people to find answers to questions themselves, we buckled down and wrote help documentation for as many integrations as possible. Instantly, the number of support queries we received decreased. Of course, our user base kept growing, so while the percentage of users who send in requests is lower than before, the total quantity is going up again. (It’s a good problem to have.)</p>
