                        <h3>Building Our Core Team</h3>
                        <p>Our team doubled in 2013, going from four to eight, but more importantly, we added three vital positions to support growth: a systems engineer (James Carr), and platform engineer (Brian Cooksey) and a designer (Al Abut). We also added our first full-time marketer (Danny Schreiber) to <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/erratic-effective-story-behind-zapier-blog-2013/">ramp up our company blog.</a></p>
                        <p>In making hires, we doubled-down <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/how-manage-remote-team/">on being a remote team</a>. Among our eight-person crew, we have people in San Francisco, Mountain View, Columbia, Omaha and Chicago.</p>

                        <p>In December 2012, our integration platform supported 123 web services, many of which had been added by us. Realizing the potential benefits to users if integrations could be quickly added without the need of our small team, in August we <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/announcing-zapier-developer-platform-join-hubspot-podio-and-12-others/">launched our developer platform</a>. This set the stage for adding 131 integrations to Zapier in 2013.</p>

                        <p>At Zapier, we've always followed <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/support-driven-development/">support-driven development</a> and in March we formalized the process to help speed up ticket responses. Doing so was significant, and though it resulted in faster response times, it didn't address our overall increasing support load.</p>
                        <p>So, in July, we began to empower people to find answers themselves, by releasing <a href="https://zapier.com/help/">help documentation</a> for as many integrations as possible. Instantly, the number of support queries decreased by a noticeable margin.</p>

                        <h3>User Experience</h3>
                        
                        <p>The January version of Zapier was drag-and-drop and playful, with the homepage allowing users to immediately begin making integrations. Our hypothesis was that the faster a visitor began using the product, the more likely they'd be to sign up.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>[NEED A SCREENSHOT HERE]</strong></p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The drag-and-drop functionality didn't work well on mobile devices and with visitors being conditioned to look for an obvious sign up button, when they didn't find one, they left.</p>
                        <p>So we remedied these issues by implementing a more traditional homepage featuring an obvious call-to-action to sign up, and we began using simple click actions instead of the drag-and-drop editor.</p>

                        <p>Though the February redesign was an improvement, Zapier&rsquo;s user experience was still limping along as the product had been created and designed by engineers &#8212; a designer&rsquo;s touch was sorely needed. Thus, as previously mentioned, we began working with a designer.</p>

                        <p>As a result, in early December we <a href="https://zapier.com/blog/inside-guide-new-zapier-now-250-supported-services/">launched our second major design update.</a></p>

                        <p>Handling millions of API calls every day is not a simple feat. By the end of 2013, Zapier was run by over 70 servers on Amazon&rsquo;s Web Service, up from a mere dozen at the beginning of 2013.</p>
